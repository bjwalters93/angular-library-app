# Route Structure for Books

1. /books route should provide a list of all books.
2. There should be add new book link or button hooked to -> /books/new, that loads the new book component that contains a form to do so.
3. Each list item should have a view book and edit book option/button that is hooked to a URL. These URL's load the view and edit component. Could be a modal ?

- /books:id <--- view
- /books/:id/edit <--- edit
